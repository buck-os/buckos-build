"""Shared environment sanitization for build helpers.

Buck2's local executor inherits the daemon's full host environment into
action subprocesses, but action cache keys only include explicitly declared
env={}.  Two hosts sharing a NativeLink CAS compute identical digests but
may produce different outputs when host env differs — cache poisoning.

This module provides a whitelist-based approach: start from a clean env
with only functional vars, pin determinism vars, and let each helper add
what it needs on top.
